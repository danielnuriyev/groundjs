All existing JavaScript frameworks focus on the UI.
The goal of groundjs is to extend JavaScript language itself.

In some cases groundjs adds functions to existing classes.
For example, it adds trim to String.

In some cases groundjs adds utilities: numUtil, timeUtil etc.

We also plan to add 
- Java implementation of CommonJS
- Functions that will allow JavaScript to run on Java

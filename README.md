## What

GroundJS provides JavaScript functions lacking JS.
Much of this stuff is already in JS itself or in lodash.
You can use each file individually.
For convenience I have created 3 merged files:
- ground.js
- ground.browser.js = ground.js + cookie.js
- prototype.js - functions attached to JS built-in objects

## Download and build

ground.js and ground.browser.js are prebuilt but you can clone the repo and run `npm run build` - this will regenerate the 2 files.

## Use

g = groundjs;

const parsedUrl = g.URL.parse(someUrl); // etc.

## TODO
list of all functions with examples
